# LAB07 - Collections
This project uses LINQ queries and Lambda expressions to extract information from a json file serving as data source.  This displays neighborhoods in Manhattan.

### Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ instead of a Lambda and vice versa.)
